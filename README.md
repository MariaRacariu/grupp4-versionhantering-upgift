# Weather24 weather website
View our project here: [https://mariaracariu.github.io/grupp4-versionhantering-upgift/]

This website allows the user to search for a city and display the current weather in that city with the name, temperature (in celcius) and the icon representing the weather.
There is also the possibility of searching for a city and view the air pollution rank of that city.  
We also have a fake about page and a contact page that does not work currently.

We used Open Weather API ([https://openweathermap.org/api]) because it was well documented, has many end points and we could see a successful project being made with our project deadline. 
One problem we stumbled over was we first wanted to implement a weather map but after some further reading into the Open Weather API we learned that we needed to use Google Maps also which we had no experience with and was gonna be out of the project's scope.

## How to use the project:
On the Home Page the user can search for a city in the input that is positioned in the middle of the page. After the user has imputed a city the search button must be pushed for the information to be displayed.
If the user uses a city name that does not exist it will display the text “City not found”. The user will have to input another city name and press the search button for a new result to appear. 
If the user has any internet issues or the API is not working the user will receive this message when attempting to search for a city “something went wrong...try again later”.

On the Air pollution page the user can input a city name and submit it by pressing the search button. The result will be displayed with a maximum of 5 cities. The cities will display their Name, Country (abbreviation form), Air Pollution Rank and a text descripting the Air Pollution Rank. 
The user can search for a new city by writing a new one in the search input and press the search button again and new cities will show. 

The About and Contact Us page are just for display right now, they do not possess any functionality yet.
